# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description

The goal was to create a dynamic 9 hour work day scheduler that a user may add their events during the day and it will be saved. Using moment.js and jquery, I was able to make this application. The day at the header of the page updates to the current time. The hour blocks change color depending on if it's the past, present, or future. There is an add event area in each row with it's own save button.
